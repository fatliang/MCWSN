The CHs are distributed in layers w.r.t the CCH at interval of Rc. The MAC
protocol used is an ideal CSMA, that is, when one CH doesn't sense the
signals of other CHs within Nintf*Rc from it, it will
send a signal and all other CHs within Nintf*Rc from it will keep silent in
the time slot. The time spent on CSMA is omitted. In simulation, when one CH is transmitting, the other CHs which
are transmitting at the same time will be reckoned as interferers and the
interference and SINR are calculated at the receiver instead of an ideal
collision free model. The rayleigh fading channel is used and the transmission
succeeds if the SINR is above a threshold.
To measure the throughput, I use the following way: each
CH will have several queues, each of which stores the packets it receives from one specific CH. For the queue corresponding to its own, there
will be infinite
packets. Once the CH wins the competition for transmission, it will transmit
one packet randomly from one of the non-empty queues.
In the CSMA protocol, each CH will wait a random time before sending the
signal. This random time is exponentially distributed and the mean is
proportional to the inverse of the number of non-empty queues in the CH.
